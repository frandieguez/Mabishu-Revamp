Mabishu Revamp - A highly simplified GTK+
=========================================

This GTK+ is based in Clearlooks Revamps but with a lot
of changes to more simplication.

INSTALLATION
============
For a better visualization install elementary nautilus just 
issuing the next commands:

sudo add-apt-repository ppa:am-monkeyd/nautilus-elementary-ppa
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get upgrade

And if you want all the monochrome icons install the 
elementary-monochrome and elementary icons set just installing 
its PPA issuing the next commands:

sudo add-apt-repository ppa:elementaryart/elementarydesktop
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get upgrade

And now download the tarball from the Downloads section in 
http://github.com/frandieguez/Mabishu-Revamp/downloads
and drop it in Appearance dialog from 
Main-menu -> System and select to get.

Enjoy my theme!
