## Mabishu Revamp - A highly simplified GTK+

This GTK+ is based in Clearlooks Revamps but with a lot
of changes to more simplication.

### INSTALLATION
For a better visualization install elementary nautilus just 
issuing the next commands:

    sudo add-apt-repository ppa:am-monkeyd/nautilus-elementary-ppa
    sudo apt-get update
    sudo apt-get upgrade

If you want all the monochrome icons install elementary-monochrome OR
my new mabishu-elementary by downloading it from:

    http://github.com/frandieguez/mabishu-elementary/downloads

And now download the tarball from the Downloads section from

http://github.com/frandieguez/Mabishu-Revamp/downloads

and drop it in Appearance dialog from 
Main-menu -> System and select to get.

Enjoy my theme!
